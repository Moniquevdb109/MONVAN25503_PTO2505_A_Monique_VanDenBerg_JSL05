## 📋 JSL05 – Task Board with Local Storage

## 💡 Overview

In this project I’m building a Kanban-style task board where tasks are saved in the browser using Local Storage. Tasks are shown in **"To Do"**, **"Doing"**, and **"Done"** columns, and I can open a modal to view task details or add new tasks through an **“Add Task”** modal.

## 🚀 What I’m Implementing

- Load tasks from Local Storage on page load (or fall back to my initial task data).
- Save new tasks to Local Storage so they stay after a page refresh.
- Render all tasks into the correct status columns.
- Use an **Add Task modal** with title, description, and status fields.
- Keep the existing task detail modal when I click a task card.
- Keep my JavaScript modular and document the main functions with **JSDoc**.

## 🎯 Outcome

By the end of this challenge I want a simple, responsive task board where tasks persist in Local Storage, new tasks can be created from a modal, and my code is clean, modular, and well-documented.
